# Titanium Alloy enhanced sql adapter

## Overview

The Titanium Alloy enhanced sql adapter is able give you better control over select statements. 99% of the code is based on this gist: <https://gist.github.com/3846337> and I changed some lines so that the sqlx adapter shows the same behaviour the default sql adapter. 

## Usage
  
Copy the sqlx.js into the folder app/lib/alloy/sync (create if it doesn't already exist) and you're done.
